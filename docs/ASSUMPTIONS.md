# Assumptions

Modelling and engineering choices that are not in `docs/DESIGN.md` or `docs/BUILD_SIM_V0.md`,
with the reason for each. Newest milestone last.

## M0: scaffold

1. **Turn 99 is 2049Q4.** The build doc says 100 turns from 2025Q1 to 2049Q4; the design doc's
   "2025 to 2050" is read as "up to the start of 2050".
2. **`t` counts quarters, and `dt` is quarters per step.** Annual mode will call `step(dt=4)`, and
   `t` still counts quarters. A stocktake fires if any quarter in the step has `t % 20 == 19`, so
   annual mode hits the same five stocktakes.
3. **Stateless RNG streams.** Each draw site gets a generator seeded from
   SHA-256(master seed, stream name, keys such as turn and nation). There is no RNG state to save,
   resumed games replay exactly, and adding a draw in one place never shifts another. Stream names
   are registered in `sim/rng.py` so a typo fails loudly.
4. **No numpy for now.** Plain Python floats keep outputs byte-identical across machines; numpy can
   be added later if a hot loop needs it.
5. **Canonical JSON.** All output uses sorted keys and rejects NaN and infinity. State hashes are
   SHA-256 of the compact encoding.
6. **No bare numbers in data files.** Every number in `data/*.yaml` must sit inside a tunable
   (`value`, `status`, `note`, optional `source` and `unit`); the loader rejects anything else.
   Strings, booleans and nulls are structural and may appear bare. Values fixed by the design doc
   (start year, 100 turns, stocktake every 20) are tagged `calibrated` with a note saying so.
7. **History lives in the world state.** `World.history` holds one compact record per turn and is
   mirrored to `history.jsonl`, so a saved `state.json` is enough to resume and still produce full
   history. Scoring in M2 will read from it.
8. **`step` is pure.** It deep-copies the world and returns a new one. Simple and safe at 16
   nations; revisit only if profiling says so.
9. **Country IDs.** ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes; the EU uses the World Bank aggregate code `EUU`.
10. **Only the `noop` bot exists in M0.** The CLI example `--bot balanced` works from M2. Submitting
    any action before M2 raises `NotImplementedError` instead of being silently ignored.
11. **`new_world` lives in `sim/state.py`.** It builds the t=0 world from config; not listed in the
    build doc's layout, but it is state construction.
12. **Action slots are not banked yet.** Slot accrual belongs with actions in M2.

## Open questions

- **Slots per quarter.** The design doc suggests 3 domestic + 2 diplomatic; the build doc says
  2 domestic + 1 diplomatic (placeholder). M2 will use the build doc's numbers unless told
  otherwise.
